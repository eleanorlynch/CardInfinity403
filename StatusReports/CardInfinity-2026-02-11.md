Status Report Week 5 High level goal: Complete a beta-version to be able to launch CardInfinity on discord and play a basic game.

Original goals for the week: 
Set up necessary tools and infrastructure for app development
Implement basic card game structure/functionality; this will be the basic framework for actually playing the game. 
Implement basic multiplayer connectivity.
Write basic unit and system tests. 
Implement very rough UI for gameplay purposes.

Progress and issues:
1/2 , Everyone has set up the necessary tools(DiscordSDK, Node.js) in order to start with the implementation and completed the majority of the code for basic card game functionality, might need to add more for GameWinner.js based on RuleSet.js
3, Didn’t get to start with the implementation for basic multiplayer use, need to move this to next weeks goals 
4, Able to successfully merge the necessary npm package setup to enable CI workflows and for testing on Mocha. Implemented and ran five unit tests using Mocha and all tests passed.
5, Able to complete rough mockups for gameplay screens and more refined mockups for rules creation and active game interfaces, and also decided on a color scheme.
