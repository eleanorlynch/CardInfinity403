Status Report Week 4
High level goal: Complete a beta-version to be able to launch CardInfinity on discord and play a basic game. 

Original goals for the week: 
1. Create an overview of our architecture, including the components and how they interact (complete task as a group by the end of the weekend)
2. Create an overview of our design for each component (complete task as a group by next Tuesday)
3. Decide on coding guidelines (complete task as a group by next Tuesday)
4. Update our product description by expanding our risk assessments, team structure, and schedule, and by adding a test plan and documentation plan.

Progress and issues: 
1,2. Successfully created an architecture and software design overview, including components and interfaces. 
3. Successfully decided on style guidelines for relevant languages and libraries, namely JavaScript, Java, and SQL integrations.

Goals for next week:
1. Set up necessary tools and infrastructure for app development, should take no longer than one or two days. 
2. Implement basic card game structure/functionality; this will be the basic framework for actually playing the game. Should be complete by EOD Sunday. 
3. Implement basic multiplayer connectivity. Ideally finished EOD Tuesday, progress will potentially spill into next week. 
4. Write basic unit and system tests. Will necessarily need to wait for completion of 2 above, should not take longer than one or two days.
5. Implement very rough UI for gameplay purposes. Mockup ideally finished EOD Friday, implementation EOD Sunday.
