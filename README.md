## Product Description
Card Infinity is a free customizable Discord app where you can set up an online card game with other player(s). Users can set certain conditions and rules of games themselves from a set list (ie. discard pile rules, hand rules, etc.) or choose from a list of precreated games. The interface will consist of the “table”, where cards are set out for play, and the users’ “hands” of cards if relevant to the current game. This will be in the form of a Discord app in order to make communication simpler and allow people to play with each other while on a call. If time allows, additional factors besides cards can be included, such as tokens and dice.
